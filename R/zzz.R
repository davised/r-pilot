# Options

#' Set the font family used for all supported text elements
#'
#' The font family used for each text element is controlled through a set of
#' options. This function sets each of these options to the same family,
#' allowing you to quickly customise the font family used by the theme.
#' Individual family options can be set with \code{options}.
#'
#' @param family The name of the font family to use.
#' @param title_family The name of the font family to use for the main chart
#'   title. This is an optional argument that lets you use a different font
#'   family for the main title. The argument is ignored if the value is NULL.
#'   The default value is NULL.
